    <h3>Race Heritage</h3>
    <p>Tour of America’s Dairyland (ToAD) presented by KwikTrip offers high-energy cycling action featuring Pro and Amateur racers from across the nation and around the world. On most days, the races run nearly non-stop from 11:00am to 8:30pm and showcase male and female athletes from a wide range of ages and skill levels.

Think cycling is a snooze? You’re wrong! The final event of each day, the Men’s Pro Race, will feature speeds exceeding 35mph! Add to that our professional announcing duo of Todd Busteed and Brad Sohner; they’ll not only thrill you with their race updates and rich color commentary, but will educate you on the sport of cycling…so you can understand race strategy and team dynamics. And they’ll keep you entertained…ask anyone who’s been to a ToAD race! Last year, Brad downed 100 cartons of Wisconsin chocolate milk over the course of 11 days, and Todd was interviewing a Great Dane on the winner’s podium.</p>
